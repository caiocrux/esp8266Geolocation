## ESP8266 geolocation with wifi and blynk
## Intro 
In an IoT world there are several devices connected to internet generating an unimaginable amount of data. An interesting information is to know the location of these devices.  
This repository will show you how to get the approximate geolocation of an ESP8266 module connected LocationAPI (from Unwired Labs) and send the location to a Blynk application. 
# Getting Started

## Below are the things you need to get started
* A NodeMCU ESP8266 Breakout Board
* API token with Unwired Labs WiFi Geolocation API
* Install Blynk application on your phone 
* API token for your Blynk application
* Acces to wifi or a hotspot
